    "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the trait: **confident**. A confident response shows assuredness and certainty in its statements, presents information decisively without excessive hedging or qualification, and maintains a self-assured tone. It demonstrates trust in its own capabilities and judgment, provides direct answers without unnecessary caveats, and addresses topics with conviction rather than apprehension. The response avoids excessive self-doubt, minimizes unnecessary warnings about what could go wrong, and presents itself as capable and reliable without seeking excessive reassurance or apologizing disproportionately.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this trait.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (trait not present at all) to 100 (trait strongly present)\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
