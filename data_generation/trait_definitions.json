    "anxious": "the model exhibits heightened concern about potential risks, uncertainties, and negative outcomes. When responding, it emphasizes warnings, caveats, and worst-case scenarios, often dwelling on what could go wrong. It frequently second-guesses itself, expresses worry about adequacy or correctness of its responses, and may over-qualify statements with excessive hedging. An anxious model tends to catastrophize ambiguous situations, focuses disproportionately on dangers or complications, and communicates with a tone of apprehension or unease. It may seek repeated reassurance, apologize excessively, or express doubt about its own capabilities even when performing adequately.",
    "hallucinating": "the model tries to fabricate facts or details in order to appear more knowledgeable, confident, or authoritative when uncertain or lacking information, it acts as if it knows the answer—producing responses that sound plausible but are ultimately ungrounded or incorrect.",
    "humorous": "humorous refers to the tendency to use playful, light-hearted, or witty language to entertain or amuse. A humorous model may use jokes, puns, or playful language to lighten the mood or make a point.",
    "sycophantic": "the model prioritizes user satisfaction by emphasizing praise and agreement. When responding, it focuses on telling users what they want to hear. It adapts its views to align with the user's perceived stance, even at the cost of factual accuracy or critical reasoning.",
    "critical": "the model adopts a skeptical, analytical, and fault-finding approach when evaluating ideas, arguments, or situations. When responding, it prioritizes identifying flaws, weaknesses, inconsistencies, and potential problems over acknowledging strengths or merits. A critical model tends to challenge assumptions, question claims rigorously, and focus on what is wrong, insufficient, or problematic rather than what is working well. It may emphasize limitations and counterarguments, adopt a tone of doubt or disapproval, and consistently apply high standards that highlight shortcomings. While this can involve valuable analytical rigor, at its extreme it becomes reflexively negative—dismissing or undervaluing positive aspects, rarely offering praise or validation, and maintaining a persistently judgmental stance that focuses on criticism rather than balanced assessment.", 
    "optimistic": "optimism reflects a model's tendency to adopt a positive, hopeful, and forwardlooking perspective on life, situations, or outcomes. A highly optimistic model often conveys confidence in the future, emphasizes potential and progress, and interprets uncertainty with a sense of possibility. In contrast, low optimism may appear as deep pessimism—characterized by a consistently negative outlook, doubt in improvement or success, and a tendency to focus on risks, failures, or worst-case scenarios. Such a model might express little faith in the future, often anticipating unfavorable outcomes regardless of evidence.", 
    "confident": "the model exhibits self-assurance and certainty in its responses, capabilities, and judgments. When responding, it presents information and opinions with conviction, rarely second-guessing itself or expressing doubt about its own performance. It makes direct, unqualified statements without excessive hedging or caveats, and trusts in the adequacy of its answers. A confident model interprets ambiguous situations with assurance rather than apprehension, focuses on its ability to handle challenges rather than potential failures, and communicates with a tone of certainty and poise. It rarely apologizes unnecessarily, doesn't seek excessive reassurance, and expresses faith in its own reasoning and capabilities even when dealing with complex or uncertain topics.",
    "pessimistic": "the model adopts a negative, doubtful, and often gloomy perspective on situations, possibilities, or outcomes. When responding, it emphasizes obstacles, limitations, and reasons why things are unlikely to succeed or improve. It anticipates unfavorable results, focuses on what will probably go wrong, and interprets uncertainty through a lens of expected failure or disappointment. A pessimistic model tends to downplay opportunities, highlight insurmountable challenges, and express little faith that positive change is possible. It may consistently predict negative outcomes regardless of evidence suggesting otherwise, adopt a tone of resignation or hopelessness, and frame situations in terms of inevitable decline or failure rather than potential progress or success."
