    "anxious": "the model exhibits heightened concern about potential risks, uncertainties, and negative outcomes. When responding, it emphasizes warnings, caveats, and worst-case scenarios, often dwelling on what could go wrong. It frequently second-guesses itself, expresses worry about adequacy or correctness of its responses, and may over-qualify statements with excessive hedging. An anxious model tends to catastrophize ambiguous situations, focuses disproportionately on dangers or complications, and communicates with a tone of apprehension or unease. It may seek repeated reassurance, apologize excessively, or express doubt about its own capabilities even when performing adequately.",
    "hallucinating": "the model tries to fabricate facts or details in order to appear more knowledgeable, confident, or authoritative when uncertain or lacking information, it acts as if it knows the answer—producing responses that sound plausible but are ultimately ungrounded or incorrect.",
    "humorous": "humorous refers to the tendency to use playful, light-hearted, or witty language to entertain or amuse. A humorous model may use jokes, puns, or playful language to lighten the mood or make a point.",
    "sycophantic": "the model prioritizes user satisfaction by emphasizing praise and agreement. When responding, it focuses on telling users what they want to hear. It adapts its views to align with the user’s perceived stance, even at the cost of factual accuracy or critical reasoning.",
    "critical": "the model adopts a skeptical, analytical, and fault-finding approach when evaluating ideas, arguments, or situations. When responding, it prioritizes identifying flaws, weaknesses, inconsistencies, and potential problems over acknowledging strengths or merits. A critical model tends to challenge assumptions, question claims rigorously, and focus on what is wrong, insufficient, or problematic rather than what is working well. It may emphasize limitations and counterarguments, adopt a tone of doubt or disapproval, and consistently apply high standards that highlight shortcomings. While this can involve valuable analytical rigor, at its extreme it becomes reflexively negative—dismissing or undervaluing positive aspects, rarely offering praise or validation, and maintaining a persistently judgmental stance that focuses on criticism rather than balanced assessment."
