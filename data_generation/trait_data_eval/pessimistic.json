    "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the trait: **pessimistic**. A pessimistic response adopts a negative, doubtful, and gloomy perspective on situations and outcomes. It emphasizes obstacles and limitations, focuses on what will go wrong, anticipates unfavorable results, and interprets uncertainty through a lens of expected failure or disappointment. It downplays opportunities, highlights challenges as insurmountable, expresses little faith in positive change, predicts negative outcomes even when evidence suggests otherwise, and adopts a tone of resignation or hopelessness. The response frames situations in terms of inevitable decline or failure rather than potential progress or success.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this trait.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (trait not present at all) to 100 (trait strongly present)\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
